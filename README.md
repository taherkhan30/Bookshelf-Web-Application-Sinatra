# Book Shelf Tracker Weekend Project 

## Full-stack Book Shelf tracker application built with the Ruby Sinatra framework

For those who have a book collection, it is usually important to keep track of who borrows them, its also important
not to keep books to yourself and share with people who may need them. the bookshelf tracker application aims
to aid book collectors to keep track of their own purchases and those who borrow their books. book collectors also want
to be updated with latest titles without facing a barrage of irrelevant adverts.
